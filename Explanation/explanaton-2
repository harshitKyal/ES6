1. First I assign JSON dataset to variable nammed bigBangTheory.

2. Have to write 3 functions as mentioned in assignent

	a- Write a function that takes Season number and episode number as input and gives all the information about that particular episode as output.

		//function to find episode by passing season number and episode number 
		let findEpisodeBySeasonNoEpisodeNo = (seasonNo, episodeNo, bigBangTheoryObject) => {

		    let flag = 0;
		    let episode;
		    //loop through every episode using for of loop
		    for (episode of bigBangTheoryObject._embedded.episodes) {
		        if (episode.number == episodeNo && episode.season == seasonNo) {
		            flag = 1
		            break; //if find then break out of the loop
		        }
		        else
		        	//do nothing
		    }
		    //printing result using template literal
		    if (flag) {
		        console.log(`The Episode detail with Season No : ${seasonNo} and Episode No : ${episodeNo} is`)
		        console.log(episode)
		    } else
		        console.log(`No Episode Found With Season No : ${seasonNo} and Episode No : ${episodeNo}`)
		}

		-In this function the inputs are seasonNo , episodeNo and bigBangTheoryJson Data set.
		- If it finds the episode , it will print on concole otherwise it will print not found
		- First function will loop through every episode of data set and if it matches , it will break out of the loop and will print coresponding output

		-calling of function:
		//function to find episode by passing seasion number and episode number 
		let seasonNo =10;
		let episodeNo = 1;
		findEpisodeBySeasonNoEpisodeNo(seasonNo, episodeNo, bigBangTheory)

	b-Write a function that can take any number of episode ids as input and returns all the information about those episodes.

		//function to find episode by passing any number of episode id's
		let findEpisodeByEpisodeIds = (bigBangTheoryObject, ...episodeId) => {

		    let resultArray = []
		    let flag = 0;
		    //loop through every episode using for of loop
		    for (id of episodeId) {
		        for (episodes of bigBangTheoryObject._embedded.episodes) {
		            if (episodes.id == id) {
		                flag = 1;
		                resultArray.push(episodes)
		                break;//if find then break out of the inner most loop
		            }
		            else
		            	//do nothing
		        }
		    }
		    //printing result using template literal
		    if (flag) {
		        console.log(`Resulted Array`)
		        console.log(resultArray)
		    } else
		        console.log(`No Episode Found With Episode id/s : ${episodeId}`)
		}

		- function will take any number if ids as input using rest parameter an will print array of episode matching the ids.

		-calling of function:

		//function to find episode by passing any number of episode id's
		findEpisodeByEpisodeIds(bigBangTheory, 2915, 2930, 2918)

	c-Write a function to search episode by its name.

		//function to find episode by passing episode name
		let findEpisodeByName = (episodeName, bigBangTheoryObject) => {

		    let flag = 0;
		    let episode;
		     //loop through every episode using for of loop
		    for (episode of bigBangTheoryObject._embedded.episodes) {
		        if (episode.name.toLowerCase() == episodeName.toLowerCase()) {
		            flag = 1;
		            break; //if find then break out of the loop
		        }
		        else
		            //do nothing
		    }
		    //printing result using template literal
		    if (flag) {
		        console.log(`The Episode detail with Episode Name : ${episodeName} is`)
		        console.log(episode)
		    } else
		        console.log(`No Episode Found With Episode Name : ${episodeName}`)
		}

		-Function here is printing the information of episode matching the name .

		-calling of function:

				
		//function to find episode by passing episode name
		let episodeName = 'Pilot';
		findEpisodeByName(episodeName, bigBangTheory)
